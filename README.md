## CONTRIBUTION MODEL
Our current open-source model works as follows. Key portions of Flarial that we deem should be private are not part of this repository.
Alongside this, the current model contains delayed releases for version updates. For instance, if the current Minecraft version is 1.21.200, Flarial's signatures and offsets on this repository will stay on the previous version of Minecraft. 

Furthermore, as an open-source contributor, you can make pull requests to Flarial with your feature of choice.
**However**, it is highly encouraged to **apply** to be part of the development team, for the moment, open a ticket in our discord.

## Supported Platforms

- **Operating System:** Windows 10/11 (64-bit processors only)
- **Minecraft Version:** Compatible with MCBE versions 1.20 and above.

## Build Guide

### Prerequisites:
1. **CMake**: Ensure CMake is installed on your system. You can download it from [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Git**: Install Git if you haven't already. You can download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the installation instructions.

3. **MSVC**: Ensure the MSVC compiler is installed on your system (**Clang would not work). You can download it from [the Visual Studio downloads page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads).

### Steps to Clone and Build the Project:

Method 1 - You can open this project in CLion or Visual Studio, and make sure to use the MSVC toolchain, preferably combined with Ninja. If you don't know what any of this means, please do some research on this matter.
Method 2 - You can use **build.bat** file as well.

By following these steps, you should be able to clone and build the project using CMake successfully.
